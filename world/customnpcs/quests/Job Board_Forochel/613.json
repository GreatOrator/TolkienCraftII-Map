    CompleteText: "I am glad you have returned, for your efforts, difficult though they may have been, have not proven to be enough. While you were away, the winds brought the howls of the Susi-väki here. Our long years of struggle with these brutes have taught us some of the meaning of their howls. Few of my people have ever heard such a fierce howl as this, and it could mean but one thing: The Susi-väki have chosen a war leader. Will you still help us?",

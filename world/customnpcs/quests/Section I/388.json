    Text: "The crebain have taken roost south-west, just beyond his camp.

Jaquemart told you that crebain followed in the wake of the Nazgûl and have taken roost outside his camp. He is sure the birds are the Enemy's spies and will report on movements in the west. He has asked you to dispose of them to prevent them from doing harm.",

    Text: "Susan believes that you can score a telling blow against the Darkholds and their masters in the northern Chetwood. Armed with a poison provided by Fernward Muddybutton, she sends you to the Darkhold camp in the Chetwood to deal with their wolf-keeper, Knaraugh, and the fell offspring of the Warg.

**Now that you have poisoned the cows, you should let Susan know and find out if she has arranged a meeting with Tigerstone yet.**",

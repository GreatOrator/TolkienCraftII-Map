    DialogText: "Let's look at it together. Oh look at this story about a woman searching for her sister. It tells about a young girl named Shyla Trevil whose family was attacked by large wolves that stood upright like humans. It says her sister was taken captive by the pack and that Shyla searched the forests day and night looking for her. This name is familiar to me. My mentor who lives in the woods west of the city is named Shyla. She is very old and I know she prolongs her life through spells and potions. Maybe you should talk to her. Tell her I sent you and then tell her what happened. Maybe she can help.",

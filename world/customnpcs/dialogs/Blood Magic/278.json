When they realized that their own selfishness and greed was taking the place of honor, kin, loyalty, and obedience to the law, they had her burned at the stake. Her ashes were buried here and a tree was planted on top. This tree eventually absorbed all the magical essence of Freya and is now a powerful magical conduit. ",

The council has always been transparent and First Sanguimancer Orsino has always been accessible to all students of all tiers…..that is until now. Now, the council holds secret meetings and we haven’t seen Orsino for weeks. To top it off, Master Blood Mages are supposed to have access to the Advanced Rituals classroom to practice the art. But now they are “off-limits until further notice.”",

We have been trying to track down the smell and all, I even hired a couple of guys earlier today, but they left in rather a hurry with narry an explanation.  I have just been so busy I have not been able to go down to the cellar.  I did not honestly think the smell was so bad to cause people to run out of here, but they left in such a hurry they dropped their key. Hey!  I don’t suppose you would be willing to go check things out for me?",

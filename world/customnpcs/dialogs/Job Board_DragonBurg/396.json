Such a beast will be hard to kill, but kill it you must, for left unchecked, it will continue to feed and grow. If you only heard rumors of it in Draconis, it lurks in the water, somewhere beneath DragonBurg. This creature must be defeated. I would ask that you do this, then return to me. But before you embark, I need to find you that key, talk to me again in a moment so I can give it to you.",

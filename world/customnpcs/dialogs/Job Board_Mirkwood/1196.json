Oderic attacked him, one of them drew a knife, they struggled - and then the knife was in Rathfic's chest, and there was so much blood....blood everywhere....I screamed! That is when my father rushed in. He took one look at Oderic standing over Rathfic's body, and hit him with the flat of his axe. Oderic didn't even try to fight back; he just dropped the knife and fell.",

                Title: "Brunhild is the only one who knows what really happened that night and you can certainly ask her to speak at the judgement. From what I have gathered, Rathfic, drunken, stormed in on the two talking and immediately started to argue. Brunhild tried to stop it and Rathfic hit her, which caused her brother to attack Rathfic with fists. Brunhild does not know when the knife showed up or how it ended up in her husband. However, Oderic was clearly remorseful.",

However, the worst attack came last night. We managed to beat the creatures back, but we lost the ponies and most of the supplies and goods. Attending to our wounds, we heard a muffled cry of alarm and saw the goblins halfway down the mountain with Dindy. I gave chase but before I could catch up, the goblins ducked into a cave and disappeared in the tunnel.",

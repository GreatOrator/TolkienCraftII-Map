    DialogText: "My soldiers did not fare as well. I was sent here to investigate a situation when we were ambushed. Some years ago, a group of nobles in Dale started to clamour for conquest and a show of strength from my father, King Bain. They accused him of having abandoned his fatherâ€™s loftier aims. Last year, these nobles found their advocate in Girion, a young man claiming to be a direct descendant of the last King of Dale before the Dragon came. This young Girion did bear a marked resemblance to his ancestors indeed and some of the nobles whispered that his claim on the throne was superior to that of King Bain himself.",

Last year, at Yuletide, something strange happened: the boy was in the main square of Dale in front of the Royal Palace, when a raven flew down, circled around him three times, and then placed a branch torn from a beech tree upon his sword arm. Many saw that as an omen that Girion would lead an army against the Elves of the Woodland Realm. ",

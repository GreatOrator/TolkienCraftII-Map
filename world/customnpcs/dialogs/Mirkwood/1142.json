My father grew suspicious of the raven and branch scene and sent spies to watch Girion. One of his counsellors reported seeing Girion talking to the bird more than once and that it seemed the bird was conveying messages  between him and someone in Mirkwood. It is then, my father sent us into Mirkwood to investigate.",

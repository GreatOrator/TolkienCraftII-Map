I became something different than the others...a tormented spirit forever bound to Melkor and his dark servant. I began to prowl Middle Earth alongside Dragons and other fell creatures among the armies of the Enemy. I feasted on the flesh of Elves and Men throughout the Ages, however it was never me. I was watching helplessly from a dream state. ",

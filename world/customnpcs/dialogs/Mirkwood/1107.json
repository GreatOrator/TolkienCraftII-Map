    DialogText: "The Enemy and his servants convinced my tormented spirit that it was the Light that was my enemy; the reason I was in this form. So, in my twisted mindset, I went after the Lamps and one by one broke them. This lamp was the last and it was promised to me once I took a physical form again. Somehow, the uncorrupted part of me, was able to hold off taking form again. Somehow, my knowledge that this was the last Lamp of Celebrimbor was enough to stop the process, but I didn’t know for how long.  Eru Ilúvatar has finally shown me mercy by sending you, but now we must speak of the Lamp.",

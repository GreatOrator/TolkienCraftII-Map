This is of particular worry at Helm’s Deep.  Without adequate protection it is likely to fall to the orc parties that attempt attacks regularly and we just do not have the manpower to defend it.  Saruman has advised me that he must remain “neutral” though I have my doubts to this and we are left vulnerable.",

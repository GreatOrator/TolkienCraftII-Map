I was about to go meet up with them to join when those riders showed up. Biggest scare of my life and seems they were really interested in finding the hideout of that group but the night patrol came by and they rode off, fast! I can tell ya though, I noticed a large flock of these black birds, kind that make you feel uneasy, head off in the direction of the Old Forest if that will help.",

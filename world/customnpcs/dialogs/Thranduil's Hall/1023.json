    DialogText: "Yes. The Wizards are very wise. Strange and stubborn at times, but wise. Those who listen to their counsel are wise as well. However, I am left with a dilemma. If the Elves reclaim the lamp, then the Woodsmen will doubtless be destroyed. It will make the Woodland Realm stronger for a while, but in the end we will be an island of light surrounded by darkness. I fear my realm will eventually fall at the last. However, I am being pressured by The Wayward Elves to take the lamp back from the Woodsmen as it belongs here rightfully. If I do not take it back, they will gain more support and the Woodland Realm will turn a blind eye to the growing shadow and it will then be too late.",

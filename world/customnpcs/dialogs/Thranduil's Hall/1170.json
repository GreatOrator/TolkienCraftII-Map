    DialogText: "Forth the hunters, brave and bold,
Nine there were, yet ‘twas foretold.
They did not shirk the oath they’d sworn,
But climbed the hills through fir and thorn
The sun their herald that first morn.
Three days they walked, and fought and bled
Horrors uncounted behind them tread.
Until at last they found the Gate
Morgoth’s maw, that pit of hate.
Noisome vapours rose from the gulf
At last the prince said “Hold, enough!
Our foe is near, we’ve found her lair.”
And from the deeps, the foetid air
Became a deathly pall, a hame of night
And darkness took him from our sight.",

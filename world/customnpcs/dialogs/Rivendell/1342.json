    DialogText: "I am beginning to see the whole picture. This man, Lockmand, went north, possibly passing close to Angband. Perhaps, an agent of the Shadow, guided him to the chain or he found it himself...the latter being unlikely. The greatest weapon of Middle-earth might well be a dragon in the north. When there was a dragon under the Lonely Mountain, Gandalf feared that the Dark Lord could use Smaug the Dreadful as a weapon, and send him to burn the North in wrath. Bard the Bowman put that fear to rest….but there are still dragons in the North. The chain is in the Misty Mountains, close enough to Khazad-dûm, the ancient fortress of the Dwarves. I fear the plan may be to lure a dragon down from the North and use the Chain of Thangorodrim to bind it to the will of the Shadow. A dragon in the Misty Mountains is a threat to the Lone-lands and the Anduin.",

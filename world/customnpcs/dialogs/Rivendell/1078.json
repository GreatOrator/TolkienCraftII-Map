The names and heroic deeds of those interred there were traditionally inscribed onto the stones placed atop their barrows. Some stories tell of Dúnedain who encountered wights were of individuals they knew in life - when hailed using the names of their departed friends, the wights would look confused, as if struggling with themselves and occasionally let people flee unharmed.",

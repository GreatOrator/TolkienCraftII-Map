    DialogText: "There is a tale from the Second Age, hearkening back from when Imladris was founded. It tells of a Númenórean captain who passed through Tyrn Gorthad returning home from the battle fought at Sarn Ford where Sauron himself was routed. Traversing the hills the captain stumbled upon a place where a fierce battle had recently taken place. The bodies of many Orcs and other fell creatures were strewn across the hills, amidst the remains of a number of Elven warriors. The greatest number of dead enemies were arranged in a wide circle about the remains of a single Elf-lord, clad in a blood soaked, once golden cloak and wielding a bright blade.",

Normally I would leave them to handle this as magic is definitely not our forte, but this one comes with some serious implications.From what they have learned so far, there is a major evil behind this and they are releasing creatures that may soon begin to become a problem for me.Issue is, I do not have the manpower. I appreciate your willingness to help with this and suggest you go see the council for more information.",

    DialogText: "Mankind can do amazing things with wood and stone, take this tower rising up to the clouds. However all that work is done with stone and wood that is dead, cut off from the Earth Spirits. What I shall teach you now is how to create stone and wood that can be built with and maintains its connection to the Earth Spirits.  Take this flower - plant it in the sun, and surround it with a ring of smooth stone or wooden logs.  Give it some time to do its work, and it will reconnect them to the earth. Harvest the resources once they change. Bring me 16 living wood and 16 living stone.",

Last night, Thranduil and a retinue of Elven warriors came to the hall demanding we return the lamp to them once you returned. He claimed it was made by his kin and rightfully belongs in his hall. Radagast spoke up against him! Everyone instantly went silent, even the Elven-king out of respect for the wizard. Radagast said the lamp was made by the Elved of Hollin and therefore rightfully belongs to Elrond of Rivendell.",

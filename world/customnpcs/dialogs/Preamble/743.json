He's second under Jorlan, one o' the strange men that I mentioned. Tigerstone handed the Darkholds over to them a short time ago, that's when bad changes started taking place around here.

Tigerstone's used me, and a lot o' other good folk here in Combe. Everything ye've seen so far in the Chetwood should prove that to you. We've risked a lot to have a chance to stop the Darkholds once and for all, @p. It is time we finish this.",

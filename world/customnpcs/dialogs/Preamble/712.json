It was my goal to join Quinn, but I have heard rumour of his fate in Edoras. They say he was stabbed with a morgul-knife and led off by some evil men -- the ones who lent the Darkholdâ€™s aid. There are few left now with power over such wounds, and those that I know of dwell some distance from here. We must find Quinn, and quickly, if we are to save him.",

    DialogText: "The later it was, the thicker the fog got. We heard sounds in the distance, like someone crying, and then metal clanging. Thistle took such a fright he bolted and we hit a runnel. Off came a wheel. Uncle could barely calm poor Thistle, we thought he’d hurt himself straining so. Uncle tried to calm him, took off his bridle and someone came out of the fog. I saw burning eyes, like fires, but so cold. I saw a pale sword, heard Uncle yell “Run, girl!” and Thistle screaming.",

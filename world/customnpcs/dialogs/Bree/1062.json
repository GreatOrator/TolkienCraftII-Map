    DialogText: "Indeed. A while later, I heard a voice and saw one of the Big Folk, down in the fog. He called me, said he’d take me someplace safe, but when I asked him to come up, he wouldn’t. He kept looking at the hill and then me, insisting that I come down to him.  When I asked him why, he snarled at me and his eyes burned right through the fog. I knew he was a Barrow-wight, then. I closed my eyes and sang an old song, so I couldn’t hear him anymore. Eventually, he went away.

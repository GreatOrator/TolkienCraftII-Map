I hit a stone while running and couldn’t figure out which way the road was. I looked up and saw the sky and stars. The fog cleared a little and I saw the hill, it didn’t look like the others. I made my way there, quick as I could. It was covered with little golden flowers, they smelled real sweet.  I climbed up the hill, leaned against one of the stones and I think I fell asleep.",

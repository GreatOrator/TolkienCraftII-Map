    DialogText: "The last night we stayed in Angmar, the fog rolled in thick. It is dangerous to stay outside when the fog rolls in like that. My kin and I were eating in the longhouse, when we heard screams coming from the other huts in the village. We ran outside and noticed the fog was now thick with smoke. Flames could be seen rising from our homes. We were frantic and bewildered and could not see well and then the Wargs came. We battled as bravely as we could but there were too many. The goblins came and took our women and children and disappeared in the night.",

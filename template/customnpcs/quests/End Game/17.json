All you need to do it talk to him again to begin.Quest Note: This quest is intended to move you beyond the borders of the pre-generated map so your base will be safe if there is a map update.  It is suggested you use this teleport to find a base location.  Make sure you have a disclocator to set at your teleport location as you will not get another key.",

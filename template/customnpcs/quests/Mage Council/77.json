Unfortunately, I fear it will not though you have robbed him of his major power, only his voice remains.Please be careful with these coins, they are unique and I can never give them back if something happens.I take my leave now as I must rush to join a council called in Rivendale, heavy is my heart, for I fear what they may be announcing.You should speak with Mithrandir, I believe your kind calls him Gandalf, in the veranda north of the party tree about that ring.",

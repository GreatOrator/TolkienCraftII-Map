something to hide which will make my job a lot harder. However, I did find this unusual dagger outside the first victim’s house. Maybe you should take it to the Mages at their guild in Draconis. I would draw suspicion from my commander if I were to go. Ask them about it and if there is any help they can offer. I will begin my covert investigation into the intentions of Commander Meredith. Don’t speak of this with anyone else.",

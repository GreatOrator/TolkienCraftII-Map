Theres a breed of bee that gets very territorial and will not stand the undead, they attack them on sight.  Granpa called them heroic bees.  Said if you could breed them up, you’d never need to build fences around your flower gardens again.   I’ve researched a bit, and think i can guide you through getting going.",

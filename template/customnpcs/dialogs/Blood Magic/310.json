Orsino possibly tried to deal with this demon by himself and in the process became corrupted or worse, possessed. Over time, Orsino possibly convinced other archmages to tap into the more dangerous practices of Blood Magic and now the corruption is spreading. This is the story I have gotten from the Archmages who arenâ€™t corrupted. ",
